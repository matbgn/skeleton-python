. Write/Draw about the problem:
.. Notes + Drawings + Descriptions

```
* Noun
    - Verb
    - Verb
* Noun
    - Verb
    * Noun
    * Noun
```

[source,python]
----
class Noun:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
----

[source,java]
----
public class Noun {
    public Noun() {
        ;
    }
}

[start=7]
. Make unit tests to match the descriptions

CAUTION: Don't avoid it!
